The Feliz scripts are designed to make installation of Arch Linux accessible to all. They are shared in the spirit of the community, subject to the conditions set out in the GNU GENERAL LICENSE.

Feliz is a progression from the Achoo scripts, and speeds up the installation of Arch Linux, plus a host of extras from the official Arch repos, like desktop environments, web browsers, office software and programming tools. Feliz is always up-to-date, as each time you run Feliz it downloads the latest version of the scripts from Github. Then Feliz helps you to enter such essential data as your location, username, etc, and works with you to set up your partitioning, then the script runs without further intervention to the end.

The latest iso, Feliz.2, builds on the best of the original Achoo and Feliz cli-style presentation. Feliz.2 is fast and easy-to-use, with helpful on-screen advice at every stage. During the installation phase, all output is displayed on the screen, so that the user can see exactly what the installer is doing - just like a manual installation.

Achoo and Feliz.1 are no longer maintained. Due to changes in Arch Linux, these older scripts may no longer work.

Burn the iso to a CD or USB stick, or run it directly in Virtualbox. It starts a live session of Arch Linux, and runs the script. All you have to do is follow the prompts. Installation follows closely the Arch Wiki beginners' guide, and hopefully you will understand something of the process by the time it has finished; you may even like to try a manual installation with the help of the Wiki.
