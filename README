The Feliz scripts are designed to make installation of Arch Linux accessible to all. They are shared in the spirit of the community, subject to the conditions set out in the GNU GENERAL LICENSE.

Feliz is a progression from the Achoo scripts, and speeds up the installation of Arch Linux, plus a 'shopping list' of extras like desktop environments, web browsers, office software and programming tools. Feliz is always up-to-date, as each time you run Feliz it downloads the latest version of the scripts from Github. Then Feliz helps you to enter such essential data as your location, username, etc, and works with you to set up your partitioning, then the script runs without further intervention to the end.

The original Feliz, now called feliz.1 has the option of either a command-line style interface or semi-graphical - however, please note that this version is no longer maintained.

The newer Feliz, feliz.2, builds on the best of the original Achoo and Feliz command-line style display - it does not have the semi-graphical display option - it is proudly cli. Feliz.2 is fast and easy-to-use, with helpful onscreen advice at every stage. During installation, all output is displayed on the screen, so that the user can see exactly what the installer is doing, helping to prepare for a manual installation at some time, using the Arch Wiki.

The original Feliz scripts are still available and functional, and your existing feliz-stable.iso will still work, but those scripts will not receive further development.

Burn the iso to a CD or USB stick, or run it directly in Virtualbox. It starts a live session of Arch Linux, and runs the script. All you have to do is follow the prompts. Installation follows closely the Arch Wiki beginners' guide, and hopefully you will understand something of the process by the time it has finished; you may even like to try a manual installation with the help of the Wiki.
