The Feliz scripts make installation of Arch Linux quick and easy.

Feliz can be run from an iso available at ... https://sourceforge.net/projects/feliz
  and ... https://github.com/angeltoast/feliz/releases
  Burn the iso to a CD or USB stick, or run it directly in Virtualbox.
  It starts a live session of Arch Linux, and runs the script.
  All you have to do is follow the prompts.
  Feliz always downloads the latest scripts from Github at the start of each installation,
  so you don't need to replace your Feliz iso every time there's a new release.

Alternatively, you can run Feliz by downloading the initialising script from Github into a running live Arch Linux session.

Here's how to do it:

  1) Download Arch Linux from ... https://www.archlinux.org/download/

  2) Either:
	(a) Burn the Arch iso image to a usb stick as described here ...
		https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media
			... or...
   	(b) To test in Virtualbox or other virtualising system, add the iso as a disk

  3) Start your Arch session, then when you have the root prompt, enter the following:
	pacman -Sy unzip

  4) Next enter:
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angeltoast/feliz-init/master/felizinit-stable

  5) Now enter: chmod +x felizinit-stable

  6) Then start Feliz by entering: ./felizinit-stable

Despite being proudly cli-only, Feliz has helpful on-screen advice at every stage, guiding you through the entering of such essential data as your location, username, etc, offering you a host of extras from the official Arch repos (like desktop environments, web browsers, office software and programming tools) and working with you to set up your partitioning. Then everything rolls along automatically, displaying all output on the screen, so you can see exactly what the installer is doing - just like a manual installation.

NOTE: From 1st March 2017, Arch Linux removed the i686 (32 bit) option from their installer. However, i686 packages will still be supported until November 2017. If you have an Arch iso dated before March 2017, or a Feliz iso dated before April 2017, the i686 option will still work. And just because the i686 software is not supported, doesn't necessarily mean that it will stop working - it will just not be updated.

And, finally, a fond farewell to you all from the creator of Feliz. I am retiring. I hope that someone will clone Feliz and keep the dream alive. Goodbye, and thanks for all the good times.
